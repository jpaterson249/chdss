```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Starting up and initial exploration
First we want to load the libraries we will need to use:
``` {r packageload, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse) 
library(skimr)
library(lsr)
```

Next we want to read in the data from the frames_ex2.csv file:
``` {r dataimport}
loc <- here("analysis","data","frames_ex2.csv")
frames <- read_csv(file = loc)
```

The data set has been imported as a tibble. Each row in the data set is
a single response, and each column is a variable:
```{r printframes}
frames
```

Another nice way to view the data is using `glimpse()` function:
```{r glimpseframes}
glimpse(frames)
```

We can use the `skim()` function to get a simple overview of each variable:
```{r skimframes}
skim(frames)
```
